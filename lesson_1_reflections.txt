How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Will point only to the diff in no time displaying a minimal section of the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If you are making changes to a file / project and you are not sure about the outcome you can always come back to the original version or to a certain step between.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Leads to a more logical way to save (commit) progress and will be easier to revisit older versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google Docs VCS is a simple version, while Git gives you the option to track all the files that are related to each others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log will show you all the changes were made to the file / project, while git diff can give you a detail comparison between to commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Becomes more easy to find and fix bugs during development time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
