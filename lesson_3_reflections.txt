1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to make your repository available to others you can push them to a public remote repository online.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In a really busy repository changes are happening very often and alter or lose your work, or even dealing with conflicts that are happening because of that. Also, a repository can contain several branches and you may not want them all locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches - you should consider creating a new branch, and not working on the master branch, when you want to try out new features or experiment, create a translation of the repository into a different language (French, Italian, etc.)
Clones - making a copy of the repository from others on your local machine so you can alter yours instead of making changes to the original one.
Forks - you clone a repository inside GitHub, than you can clone to your machine.
If we clone a repository from another person directly into our machine you won't be able to push your commits back, unless you have permission. While making a fork than clone locally, your push commits will go under your GitHub account.
